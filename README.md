# InternshalaBot
A bot that will log in to internshala and will keep applying for internships. Uses Selenium, BeautfulSoup and ConfigParser


# To add/change
- Use a Scheduler or Threading to run the apply() function
- Instead of using sleep() use selenium waits
- Currently, out of 10 I am experiencing that it fails to apply for more than 4 so need to debug and fix
